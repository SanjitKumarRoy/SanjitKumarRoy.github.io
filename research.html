<h2>Research</h2>
<h3>Dept. of Computer Science of Engineering, IIT Guwahati (Jul. 2013 -Till Date)</h3>
<p><b>Doctor of Philosophy</b> (Tentative Thesis submission by mid of February, 2021).<br />
<b>Thesis Title:</b> New Approaches to Computation-Communication Co-scheduling in Real-time Cyber-Physical Systems.<br />
<b>Supervisors:</b> <a href="http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~arnab/">Dr. Arnab Sarkar</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.iitg.ac.in/ckarfa/index.html">Dr. Chandan Karfa</a> (Administrative Supervisor).<br /></p>
<p>The principal aim of my Ph.D. dissertation has been to investigate a few important theoretical and practical aspects of task-message co-scheduling strategies in safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), keeping in view the challenges/hurdles related to timing requirements, resource constraints, energy minimization, etc. The dissertation presents a few novel real-time optimal/heuristic offline task-message co-scheduling strategies for safety-critical CPSs consisting of various types of task and execution platform scenarios. In particular, the major contributions of my work include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Development of co-scheduling strategies for a set of independent periodic tasks executing on a bus-based homogeneous multiprocessor system, with the objective of maximizing system level Quality of Service (QoS).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Design and implementation of QoS adaptive scheduling mechanisms for real-time systems modeled as Precedence-constrained Task Graphs (PTGs), on fully-connected heterogeneous multiprocessor systems.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Development of optimal and heuristic co-scheduling strategies for PTGs executing on a shared-bus based heterogeneous distributed platform.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Design of an energy-aware processor-bus co-scheduling strategy for multiple independent PTGs executing on a bus based heterogeneous platform.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Future Research Work</h2>
<p>The static resource allocation strategies developed as part of the Ph.D. work are based on wort-case resource usage estimates of applications. These schemes may be prone to significant performance degradations when actual resource usage of the applications are significantly less than their worst-case estimates.<br /> </p>
<p>Research in the last few years has revealed that the mapping and scheduling mechanisms in these scenarios may need to be both static and dynamic. The static part first provides a cost-optimal constraint-driven scheduling, allocation and assignment of various functional components of all the available resources; this step should not be intended to generate a single solution, but to generate an execution plan consisting of a set of optional solutions which the dynamic part can use to take decisions according to different run-time conditions. The dynamic part should be fast and must efficiently do a combined architecture load and power-aware run-time scheduling according to the execution plan provided by the static part, such that real-time constraints are met. However, determination of the exact offline-online strategies to be employed for specific system scenarios at hand is non-trivial and demands considerable research.</p>
